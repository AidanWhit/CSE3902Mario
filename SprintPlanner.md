## Notes
 * **Aidan's Portion:** The player took much longer than I was anticipating to finish. A major refactoring of the player code added a lot of extra time that I did not initially account for. In essence, the effort put in was much much larger than what I was expecting.

## Backlog to be finished next Sprint :
* Fix Crouching so that Mario moves down to the correct level
* Make Fireballs move diagonally all the way to the ground before they start bouncing
* Add properties/functions to enemies so that they can interact with the environment/player (e.g. health, move, take damage)
