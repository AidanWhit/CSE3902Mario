Class Overview:
The EnemyCycler class is designed to manage a collection of enemies (IEnemy objects) and allows cycling through them using the methods CycleEnemyLeft() and CycleEnemyRight(). This could be useful for debugging, viewing different enemies, or switching between them during gameplay.

Strength:
1. Simple Design:
This class is easy to understand, with two main methods that cycle through a list of enemies in either direction.
2. Names of objects, classes, methods are intuitive and descriptive, clearly telling the reviewer their functionality.
3. The methods are focused on a single task, which contributes to the readability.

Suggestions:
1. Although all names are descriptive, comments are still a pivotal part of a class. Comments can help developers who are not part of the project become familiar with the code more quickly.
