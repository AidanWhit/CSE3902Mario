Coupling: Moderate
This class has a moderate level of coupling due to its reliance on other classes like GameObjectManager, ICollideable, and ICommands. It depends on GameObjectManager to get the collisionDict dictionary and to store command mappings. Additionally, it heavily utilizes reflection to dynamically load types from other classes based on XML configuration, which increases coupling because any change in the structure or naming of commands and types would directly affect the functioning of CollisionResponse.

Cohesion: Low
The CollisionResponse class combines several responsibilities. It not only handles collision responses but also parses XML to load a dictionary of collision types and commands. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle, as it mixes configuration loading logic with runtime collision handling logic. By combining these roles, the class is less cohesive and more challenging to maintain, as modifications to either collision handling or XML parsing would require changes in the same class.

Suggestions for Improvement:
A good improvement would be to separate the configuration loading logic from the collision response handling. Creating a dedicated CollisionConfigLoader class to parse the XML and populate collisionDict would reduce CollisionResponseâ€™s responsibilities, making it more cohesive and focused on handling collisions. The new CollisionConfigLoader class could be responsible for reading and managing collision data, and CollisionResponse could simply call this loader to retrieve the necessary dictionary.
