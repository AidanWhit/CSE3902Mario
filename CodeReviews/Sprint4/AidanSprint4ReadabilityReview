What is readable: 
  All of the variables names are well named so there is no confusion when trying to understand what this variables
  represent in the game. The functions are also well named and clearly illustrate what their intended purpose is. 

What is not readable: 
  The implementation of some functions could lead to confusion if someone were to read this code that was not familiar 
  with C#. For example, in the GetCollisionType() function, the return line of "return typeof(StaticCoin).name" could be
  difficult to understand if the reader is not familiar with the C# type system. A simple comment could be added above this
  line to allow readers who may not familiar with the C# type system to understand the code. The DeleteItem function could
  also be more readable as the reader as not idea what the static coin is being removed from in gameObjectManager.
  There is no indication that it is being removed from lists contained within GameObjectManager.
