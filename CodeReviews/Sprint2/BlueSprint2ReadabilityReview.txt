Readability Review:

There are lots of private variables at the top of the file that are not organized very well, and some of them aren't even used. 
LoadContent() is also very crowded, as there is a lot of commented out code that could be deleted. Declarations of enemy, item, and block lists could also be hidden better with #region as we saw in class this week. 
Keyboard RegisterCommand methods are okay for now but will need to move into level loader eventually. 
Draw() and Update() also contain some commented out code that coule be removed. Christian needs to change the block drawing system to cycle like item and enemy.
