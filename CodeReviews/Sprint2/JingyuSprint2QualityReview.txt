Name of file being reviewed : "MarioSpriteFactory.cs"
Author of file being reviewed : Aidan Whitlatch
Time taken on review : 30 mins

Coupling: Medium
MarioSpriteFactory is responsible for creating all the Mario sprites.
Tightly coupled with the ISprite implementations(StaticMarioSprite, AnimatedMarioSprite).
- Better to add few abstractions in order to reduce coupling and apply SOLID principles.(add abstractions so that if we want to add new states of mario in the future we dont have to change the code)

Cohesion: High
The class has high-level cohesion, as it focuses on managing the sprites for Mario and fireballs. 
- Need refactoring, like puttingh fireball-related methods to another factory (ProjectileFactory) could help reduce the responsibilities handled in this class.
