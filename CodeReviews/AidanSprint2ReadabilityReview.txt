What is Readable : 
  All of the other variables are readable as the exactly illustrate their purpose. For example,
  Texture, Velocity, and Position clearly illustrate their purpose within the sprite based on their
  name alone. I also thought that the currentFrame and totalFrames variables were readable but that
  I realized that might only be because of my familiariy of the project. They could be updated to
  currentAnimationFrame and totalAnimationFrames to fully get the point across of what their exact
  purpose is. 
What is not Readable : 
  The name of the ticks variable provides very little meaning as to what its purpose is. It also
  is initialized to an int of one and then continiually set to be equal to one during the update 
  loop. Maybe this was accidently left in or it will be used further down the road but at the current
  moment, it is not clear what its purpose is.
