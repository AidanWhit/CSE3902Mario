What is Readable: 
The variables and function names have clearly defined meanings, that are descriptive in their functions (bowserBehaviour, OnTimedEvent, etc.)

What is not Readable:
While all the names do have clear definitions, there are a lot of variables and functions in the class, that cloud the readability somewhat.
Maybe another class could have been used to help readability and cohesion, splitting the functions into different classes.
Additionally, there is a magic number (patrolRange).
