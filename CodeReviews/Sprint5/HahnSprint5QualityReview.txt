Comments on Quality:

Coupling: Medium
Although it is usually through singletons, the Spawner class does reference other classes extensively, for example with the game itself, or creating a new levelloader.

Cohesion: High
The Spawner class focuses on Mario and setting his spawning position, and teleporting him to it whenever needed. There is no other function of the class.


Suggestions for Improvement:
There are a lot of dead comments in the code that no longer seem to have purpose, that hinders readability. 
There also seems to be functions that are not used anywhere: GetSpawnLocation() and Spawn().
