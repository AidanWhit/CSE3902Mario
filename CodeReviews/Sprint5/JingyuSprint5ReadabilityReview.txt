What is Readable:

Variable Names: Clear variable names like firePoint, rotation, playerFacing, and offset in Gun.cs. XPos, YPos, and Velocity in GunPickup.cs and Bullet.cs are consistent and follow good naming conventions for position and motion.

Separation: Each class (Gun, Bullet, and GunPickup) encapsulates its responsibilities effectively.
Gun.cs focuses on the weapon's functionality, while Bullet.cs handles the projectile behavior, and GunPickup.cs deals with the item pickup mechanics.

GameObjectManager Integration: Use of GameObjectManager to manage instances of bullets and pickups is clear and aligns well with the architecture of the project.


What is Not Readable:

Rotation Updates: The UpdateRotation method in Gun.cs has dense trigonometric calculations and clamping logic, Breaking it into smaller methods (e.g., CalculateRotation and ClampRotation) would improve readability.

Lack of Comments for Calculations: In Gun.cs, some methods lack comments explaining the mathematical operations.

Magic Numbers: numbers like heightScale = 0.375f in Gun.cs and timer = 1.5f in ScorePopup are magic numbers.
