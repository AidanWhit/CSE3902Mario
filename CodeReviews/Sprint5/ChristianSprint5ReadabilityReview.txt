What is readable: 
All of the short methods towards the bottom of the file are very short and
readable, often just having one line for the return. The DeleteHammer method
simply uses the Remove method from GameObjectManager to cleanly remove the
object from the list of game items, and it is easily understood just by looking
at it. The class implements multiple interfaces, and it is immediately clear how
the object will behave in game.

What is not readable:
The Update method may be a little confusing without comments as to what the if
statements actually do, and the calculating of the position variables could also
benefit from a short comment explaining how and why it is done. Other than that
small thing, the file is very readable and easy to grasp.
