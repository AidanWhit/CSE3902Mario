What is readable: 
All of the variable names used are quite descriptive and clearly convey their intended purpose within the code. This similary applies to the 
function names as their given names are clear enough that additional clarifying comments are not needed. 

What is not readable:
I can not find anything within this code that I personally find not readable. All of the code within the functions is simple which leads to easy
understanding by the readers who are not familiar with the project. The only thing that I could consider slighly undereadable would be the variable
range. It could be given a slightly more descriptive name that clearly illustrates that it details the range of movement along the x axis that the
platform can move in. Other than that one very small nitpick, I really can not think of any other things that are unreadable in this code.
