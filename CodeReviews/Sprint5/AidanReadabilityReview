What is readable: 
Most of the variable names used within this class cleary describe what the variable is going to be used for. Most of the function names are
very descriptive which allows new readers of this code to understand the purpose of the function at a glance. Comments are also
provided above functions or certain critical sections of code which further adds to the interpretability of the code

What is not readable:
When the Spawner Instance is declared, the operator ?? is used. Personally, I had to look up the meaning of this operator because just by
looking at it, there is no way to understand what it is doing. A comment could be provided to describe the function of the ?? operator 
to allow views to understand the purpose of the operator, especially in the context of the code. Another aspect of the code that is 
slightly undereadble is the function name Spawn. It is not clear what object's spawn this is refering to but there is a comment provided
above the header to aid in the understanding. To improve the readability, the Spawn method could be given a more descriptive name such as
DefaultSpawnForPlayer.
