What is Readable:

Variable names like score, coins, time, and lives are self-explanatory and align well with the purpose of the HUD.
The use of the singleton pattern (HUD.Instance) is straightforward and easy to understand for a shared resource.

What is Not Readable:

The hard-coded time values (e.g., time = 400, timer = 1.5f in ScorePopup) could be extracted as constants or configurable parameters for better readability and easier maintenance.
