What is readable:
Each accessor method is very short and easy to understand,
with short parameter lists and clear naming. Methods are named
in such a way that it is clear what they do, and variables
are named in a way that it is clear what they store.

What is not readable:
The method LoadSpriteMachine() is a little long and could
benefit from a few comments that walk thought the process,
especially because it calls methods from another class called
XmlReader.
