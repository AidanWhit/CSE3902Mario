Review of the BlockFactory.cs:
The BlockFactory class is designed to create different types of block objects for the
game using the Factory design pattern. The class is generally well-structured and
follows good practices for encapsulation and the Singleton pattern.

Strengths:
1. Singleton Pattern:
This class correctly implements the Singleton pattern using a private constructor and
static key word. 
2. The LoadAllContent method is centralized, which is easy to manage and update
textures in one place.
3. Coupling: All dependencies are necessary and unavoidable for the class to function.
The coupling degree is acceptable.
4. Cohesion: The class has high cohesion in terms of its role as a factory for block
creation.

Suggestions:
The LoadAllContent method introduces a slightly different responsibility, which is to
load textures. While still related to block creation, it could be seen as a separate
responsibility from object creation, potentially reducing cohesion slightly. Move the
content loading responsibility to a separate class or service, such as a ContentLoader.
The BlockFactory could then take the loaded textures as parameters or dependencies, 
focusing solely on block creation.

Hypothetically Scenario:
Suppose we want to add a new block type, a “Timed Block,” which changes its appearance and behavior after a
certain amount of time. This block should initially look like a regular block (e.g., questionBlock) but should
switch to a “depleted” state (e.g., hitBlock) after a few seconds.
The current implementation of BlockFactory is well-structured to accommodate the addition of new block types 
like the “Timed Block” with minimal changes. Adding new methods to the factory and loading additional textures
are straightforward processes.
