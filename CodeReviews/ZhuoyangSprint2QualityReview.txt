Review of the BlockFactory.cs:
The BlockFactory class is designed to create different types of block objects for the
game using the Factory design pattern. The class is generally well-structured and
follows good practices for encapsulation and the Singleton pattern.

Strengths:
1. Singleton Pattern:
This class correctly implements the Singleton pattern using a private constructor and
static key word. 
2. The LoadAllContent method is centralized, which is easy to manage and update
textures in one place.
3. Coupling: All dependencies are necessary and unavoidable for the class to function.
The coupling degree is acceptable.
4. Cohesion: The class has high cohesion in terms of its role as a factory for block
creation.

Suggestions:
The LoadAllContent method introduces a slightly different responsibility, which is to
load textures. While still related to block creation, it could be seen as a separate
responsibility from object creation, potentially reducing cohesion slightly. Move the
content loading responsibility to a separate class or service, such as a ContentLoader.
The BlockFactory could then take the loaded textures as parameters or dependencies, 
focusing solely on block creation.
