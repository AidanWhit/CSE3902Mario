Readable : 
There are several public variables that seem to be used by various states and sprites. Their names are generally clear, (xPos/yPos for mario's position, PlayerState and PhysicsState for his state's, etc.). All of the function names are descriptive as well, clearly stating what action they are associated with. 

Not Readable : 
The boolean variable "isCrouching" does not seem to be used, at least at the moment. Even in the function Crouch(), isCrouching is not updated anywhere. Additionally, there is a magic number 2, which could be explained further; The maximum number of fireballs that Mario can throw at a time is indeed 2, but it could be initialized as a final variable.
