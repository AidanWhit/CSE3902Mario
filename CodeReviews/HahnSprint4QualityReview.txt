Name of file being reviewed : SoundManager.cs

Time Taken: 20 min

Code Quality Review:

Coupling: Low
SoundManager does reference the XNA MediaPlayer class in order to manage the game's music and sound.
Other than that, there is little to no coupling between SoundManager and the other classes in the game.

Cohesion: High
The SoundManager is a singleton, which does mean that there are problems with cohesion inherent with the singleton pattern.
But otherwise, the file is cohesive by sticking to its name, SoundManager, and performing all of the functions revolving around sfx and music, such as loading or stopping whenever necessary. 

Suggestions for Improvement:

Remove dead code/comments by removing the unnecessary bits.
