What is Readable:

Using ToList() ensures modifications can be made while iterating without affecting the collection.

Using the helper method GetHitBox() improves readability, as hitbox intersections are critical for collision checks.

What is Not Readable:

The use of many nested foreach loops makes the code hard to follow and adds complexity, especially when multiple game objects are involved.

The enemy.Equals(enemy2) check could be more descriptive by separating logic or creating a specific method that checks if two enemies are the same.
Thereâ€™s some inconsistency with naming conventions ( marioColumn and fireballColumn could be better abstracted).
