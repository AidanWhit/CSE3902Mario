What is readable: 
  A majority of the variable names within this file are very descriptive and clearly get the point
  across of what they are meant to represent. The variables of float cameraX and Vector2 Position
  may be a little confusing becuase at first glance it may seem as if they are representing the
  same data when in reality, cameraX is used to update the value of Position.


What is not readable: 
  Some of the built in MathHelper functions are not readable based on solely their name alone. 
  It could be because I am not familiar with the functions provided in MathHelper but a comment
  could be used to describe what the function is doing to make the code more readable for people
  who are not familiar witht the MathHelper library. The same critique applies for the Matrix
  functions used. The Transform variable helps signify what the overall goal of the functions is 
  but it is very difficult to understand what Matrix.CreateTranslation() does. Comments could be 
  provided to help make these function calls more readable.
