Comments on Quality : 

Coupling : Low
  LevelLoader only relies on the GameObjectManager class to add newly created objects into the
  lists present within GameObjectManager which is absolutely necessary. In our current design,
  there is no way to implement LevelLoader without adding to lists present in GameObjectManager.
  This is the only class that LevelLoader relies on so this coupling is absolutely necessary.
  Therefore, this class has low coupling because the coupling present is unavoidable. 
Cohesion : High
  LevelLoader has one job and that is to load all of designated objects from the XML file and then
  add them to a GameObjectManager so these objects can be drawn/updated. The LevelLoader does not
  take on any additional responsibilites besides that so it fulfills the single responsibility 
  code metric implying that this class has high cohesion.

Suggestions for Improvement: 
  One suggestions is allow the levelloader to populate dictionaries within the factories so
  that the data specified within the levelfile will determine locations/sizes of sprites. This
  would allow our entire art system to become more modular as data files could be swapped out
  resulting in an entire new set of artwork being displayed on the screen. The same could
  be done for controls used for the game.
