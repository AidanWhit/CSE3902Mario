Comments: 
GameObjectManager is a singleton class that has low coupling and high cohesion.
It contains useful lists of objects that referenced by the collision engine,
but they are left public. There are very clear and concise clear methods, as
well as a useful GetNearbyBlocks method that contains a short if structure to
check columns one by one. Overall, the code is very high quality but would also
benefit from some small optimizations.

Suggested Changes:
Add a few methods to add and delete single items from each list and make the
list fields private. Other code that wants to add or delete should have to go 
through a method to reduce coupling.
