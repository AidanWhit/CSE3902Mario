Overview: 
It is a singleton responsible for managing all game objects, collisions, and their states in the game. 
It interacts with the player object, tracks updateable and drawable game elements, handles block collisions, 
and provides a central point for managing these elements across different frames.

Strengths:
	1.	Singleton Design Pattern: Ensuring a single instance of the GameObjectManager through the singleton pattern 
      allows centralized management of game objects.
	2.	Clear Separation of Responsibilities: Objects are divided into separate lists like Updateables, Drawables, 
      Movers, and Static, making it clear how each object type is handled.
	3.	Collision Handling Infrastructure: The class includes a collisionCommandMap and a CollisionDetection component, 
      making it flexible for implementing collision-based game logic.

Suggestions:
  1. Simplify Conditionals in GetNearbyBlocks2: The GetNearbyBlocks2 method has multiple nested conditionals. 
     Consider restructuring the logic for clarity.
  2. Unused Methods: UnloadObjects is currently empty. If this is planned functionality, adding a TODO comment 
     would be helpful for future maintainers.
