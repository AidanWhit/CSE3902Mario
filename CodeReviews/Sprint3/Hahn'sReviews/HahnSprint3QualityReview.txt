Coupling: High
The command is highly coupled with the Player class, and refers to it in almost every part of the code.  
However, this makes sense as the command detects and acts upon collisions with mario, and must access the player class to do so. 
I don't think there is a way to refactor this code to have less coupling, by the design of the command pattern.

Cohesion: High
The class only has two functions including the constructor, and as with all the other commands, has a clear .Execute() function that is executed when called.
