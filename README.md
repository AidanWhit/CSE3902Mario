## Tools and Processes Used

1. **Command Pattern:**
   - The project implements the Command pattern for handling user inputs. Each command is encapsulated in its own
    class, making the codebase modular and easier to manage.

2. **Cycling Mechanism:**
   - The project uses custom cycler classes (`EnemyCycler`, `ItemCycler`, `BlockCycler`) to manage the cycling of
    different game elements, enabling easy switching between different game objects for testing and gameplay.

3. **Factories:**
   - The Factory pattern is used for creating various game objects like enemies, items, and blocks. This helps in
   maintaining the code by centralizing the object creation logic.

4. **Sprite Management:**
   - A centralized SpriteFactory is used to load and manage all sprite assets, ensuring efficient memory usage and
   organization.

## Known Bugs
* When mario powers up, his location does not update as it should. If there was a floor, mario's feet would be clipping
  through the floor when he powers up.
* If a fireball is shot when mario is jumping, it will not fall all the way to where the ground should be before it starts boucing.
  Instead it moves a set distance downward before it begins its bouncing behavior
* xml file from the XMLgenerator might generates a file start with:
  "line1: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
   line2: <?xml version="1.0" ?>"
    delete the line2 before using this file
