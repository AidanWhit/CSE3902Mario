File Reviewed: LevelLoader.cs
Author of File: Hahn Choi
Time taken on review: 15 minutes

Strengths:
Method names are all very clear, and method bodies contain simple switch case
statements that are easy to follow. It is easy to tell that the LevelLoader
adds new objects by calling the GameObjectManager singleton and correctly
throws an error when an input is not recognized.

Suggestions:
The LoadLevel method would really benefit from some comments explaining what
each block of code does, since there are lots of XmlReader methods being called
that do not have clear meaning in this code.
